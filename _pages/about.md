I’m **Han Lyu**, a senior majoring in **Computer Engineering** at the **University of Wisconsin–Madison**. I’m passionate about **AI hardware design and implementation**, computer architecture modeling, VLSI, and embedded systems — essentially, how hardware and intelligence come together.

I currently work with Professor Umit Ogras's [E-lab](https://elab.ece.wisc.edu/), Contributing to the development of a novel domain-specific hardware architecture targeting efficient Mamba LLM workloads, responsible for design-space exploration (DSE) and hardware implementation in SystemVerilog, integrating performance, area, and power trade-offs to guide architectural design decisions.  

The work is under preparation for submission to **ISCA 2026** and a tape-out.

If you’re also excited about hardware design or related research, feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:hlyu42@wisc.edu) — I’d love to connect!

How Software Bugger started his hardware journey
======
Like many of my peers, I entered college without a clear sense of my technical interests. But on the very first day I learned programming — Python, in my case — I found myself asking not how to write better code, but why the language itself works the way it does, and how computers interpret it.

That single question led me down a long and exciting path. After completing my freshman year at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, I decided to transfer to the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where I discovered the deeper layers beneath software. My journey moved from embedded systems and device drivers, to register-level programming, and eventually to hardware design using SystemVerilog. I’ve since built a 5-stage pipelined CPU, explored GEM5 simulation, and studied out-of-order execution and domain-specific computing architectures.

Hardware and low-level programming fascinate me because they reveal the full stack — from logic gates to high-level algorithms — and show how the future of computing is being built layer by layer.

Beyond a Bugger
======
Beyond a being a Bugger, I am a person with multiple passions. I enjoy cooking and of course foods from different cultures. I am also a amateur singer, a marvel/cartoon/anime ethusiast, a language fan and a animal/paleontology lover :) Yes, this is a huge combo.
